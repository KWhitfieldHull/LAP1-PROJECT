## Description

Students have expressed a strong desire for a more engaging approach to learning non-STEM subjects. In response, this project has been developed with the primary goal of making learning enjoyable and interactive for all students. Specifically designed as a history quiz, our project is tailored to benefit key stage 3 students. Our aim is to reinforce the knowledge students acquire in their history lessons by presenting questions related to key subject areas. These topics encompass Medieval history, Revolutions, as well as World War 1 and World War 2.

## Process

### Backend

<img src="Img/Backend_image.png">

* We initiated the process by searching for a trivia API that offers history-related questions at the following URL: https://the-trivia-api.com/api/questions?categories=history
* Following that, we established the backend functionality by retrieving data from the API
* Next, we identified the pertinent topics from the history API by utilising tags
* Subsequently, we organised distinct sections for each of these topics

### HTML/CSS

* Made sure a random selection of questions was supplied from the api
* Made sure the answers had randomised positions
* Made sure when check is clicked, if answer is correct, answer appears green
* Made sure when answer is incorrect, incorrect answer appears red, along with correct answer appearing green
* Made sure when answer is incorrect a section appears at the bottom of the screen that takes the user to the relevant Wikipedia article
